Redgem is a Sharetunnel owned project that is used to create simplistic websites all the way to full on database-powered applications. It's all about the modding you put 
into it.

The point of it's existence is to provide a simplistic but powerful base slate for you to build your application upon. It is meant to be modded and extended with other people's ideas.
We are working on making it simple to use and setup while also adding nice features that will make it robust at the same time.
