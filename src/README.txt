----------Redgem Framework 1.6----------

What's new::

-> Use the template/layouts folder to create your different layouts for your site and manage them in one place, then insert them in your views
-> Use the modules directory to extend your views with different functionality if needed. It's also a good place to put remotely called ajax functionality (instant)
-> Use template to put your images, icons, stylesheets, etc in.
-> Core contains functions that should be available to any view or other page on the site
-> Modifying is the best part of Redgem, if you see a place where you would like to add stuff, Please DO. :)
